In order to further assure if Des Moines, Iowa is a good fit, an analysis on the number and location of tourism attractions throughout the city need to be analyzed. Also, census data about the town's residents such as gender, age, employment rate, etc. also need to be analyzed. These analyses will provide a stronger case for investors to provide funding for Citibike in Des Moines, Iowa.
